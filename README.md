helper-functions.js for Synchronet
==================================

What is this?
-------------

This is a quick-and-dirty upload of a set of utility functions I use in many Javascript projects for my Synchronet BBS.

For example, there's not a great way to see debug output, so I wrote a `debug()` function to dump things to an external text file. I use this to help me debug scripts as I'm writing them.

Similarly, I create debugFrameDump to serialize the contents of a Synchronet Frame object and dump them into a text file.

Anyway, it's a bunch of utilities like that. Many of my libraries and projects depend on this.
